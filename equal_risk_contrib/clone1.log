Number of nonzeros in lower triangle of Q = 45
Using Approximate Minimum Degree ordering
Total time for automatic ordering = 0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
Summary statistics for factor of Q:
  Rows in Factor            = 10
  Integer space required    = 10
  Total non-zeros in factor = 55
  Total FP ops to factor    = 385
Tried aggregator 0 times.
Reduced presolve added 0 rows and 10 columns.
Reduced QP has 11 rows, 20 columns, and 75 nonzeros.
Reduced QP objective Q matrix has 10 nonzeros.
Presolve time = 0.00 sec. (0.01 ticks)
Parallel mode: using up to 10 threads for barrier.
Barrier time = 0.00 sec. (0.01 ticks)

Dual simplex solved model.
