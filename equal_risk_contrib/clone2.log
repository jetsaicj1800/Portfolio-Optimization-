Number of nonzeros in lower triangle of Q = 45
Using Approximate Minimum Degree ordering
Total time for automatic ordering = 0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
Summary statistics for factor of Q:
  Rows in Factor            = 10
  Integer space required    = 10
  Total non-zeros in factor = 55
  Total FP ops to factor    = 385

Using LP solver to compute a starting basis.

Dual simplex solved model.
